## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```

Once the repository is cloned, open the `index.html` file in a text editor. This file contains the HTML code for the login and registration form.

## HTML Code

The HTML code for the login and registration form is relatively straightforward. The form is contained within a `<form>` element, and the individual form fields are contained within `<input>` elements. The `<input>` elements are of type `text`, `password`, and `submit`.

The following code snippet shows the HTML code for the login form:

```html
<form class="form-login">
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username">

  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" name="password">

  <input type="submit" value="Login">
</form>
```

The following code snippet shows the HTML code for the registration form:

```html
<form class="form-reg">
  <label for="username">Username:</label>
  <input type="text" id="username" name="username">

  <label for="password">Password:</label>
  <input type="password" id="password" name="password">

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email">

  <input type="submit" value="Register">
</form>
```

## CSS Code

The CSS code for the login and registration form is used to style the form elements and make the form look more visually appealing. The CSS code is contained within the `style.css` file.
